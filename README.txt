1. The map file for snake.asm is called "map.txt".
2. The map file is a 2D arrays of 1s and 0s with each line ending with a "\n" character.
3. "1" is a wall pixel, and "0" is a blank pixel.
4. Theres no space between each pixel.
5. Each row should have exactly the same column and the last row may or may not be ending with a "\n" character.
6. To modify the map, just replace the 1s with 0s or 0s with 1s, all as you prefer.
